# Responsive Portfolio:

Creating a website about my work and my information for the first time. The website will respond to different viewpoints with different devices. Ensuring my personal website will be mobile-first application and responsive design base on devices. 


## Design

I wanted a simple/ clean look to the front page so I decided on a more white and gray theme with font taken from google font. This theme follows all three pages that link to the homepage. 

The design and layout are based on bootstrap 

Finally, the social media icon is from cloudflare instruction taken from w3school



### Homepage - index.html


* About me page included 

   * title with navbar toggle when uses a mobile device

   * main included 2 pictures with introduction paragraph

   * footer includes 2 links to social media channel


### Portfolio Page 

* using the same design as homepage for navbar and footer

* main added row and column layout from bootstrap and using placeholder for the meantime as no project has been submitted


### Contact Page

* Same design as Homepage and Portfolio for navbar and footer for consistency throughout all 3 pages

* form is used in Main to capture information to use later one. 

* Will try to integrate info capture with google sheet later on.


## Commit with each step

I understand the importance of committing and pushing work to github often. Therefore, each change throughout my work I had consistently committed and push work to github as new work is added. However, I only commit when one section is done to prevent confusion. This will help build a favorable habit for better collaboration in the future.
